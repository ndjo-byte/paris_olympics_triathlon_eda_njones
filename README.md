Triathlon Race Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of triathlon race performance to investigate two primary hypotheses:

1. The bike leg, as the longest part of the race, is the most decisive in determining the winner.
2. The swim leg, being the first part of the race, is the most competitive.

Overview

In this project, I analysed triathlon race data from the past 6 Olympic Games to uncover insights into how each leg of the race—swim, bike, and run—contributes to overall race outcomes.

Key Questions:

Is the bike leg the most critical for determining the winner, given its length?
Is the swim leg the most competitive, as it sets the tone for the race?
Using Python and popular data analysis libraries such as pandas and numpy, I cleaned, processed, and analysed race data. For visualisation, I used seaborn and plotly to create dynamic plots that highlight trends and relationships between performance across race segments.

Technologies Used

Python for data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy and Pandas for data processing and statistical calculations.
Seaborn and Plotly for visualization of patterns and trends.

Analysis Highlights

Segment Correlation: Investigated the relationship between performance in each segment and overall race results.
Time Distributions: Visualised time distributions across different race legs to assess variability and competitiveness.
Competitiveness: Examined the relative competitiveness of each leg, focusing on tightness in time spreads across athletes.
